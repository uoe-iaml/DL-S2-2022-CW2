    "\n",
    "#### It is important that you follow the instructions below carefully for things to work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to set up and activate your environment as you would do for your labs, see Learn section on Labs.  **You will need to use Noteable to create one of the files you will submit (the PDF)**.  Do **NOT** create the PDF in some other way, we will not be able to mark it.  If you want to develop your answers in your own environment, you should make sure you are using the same packages we are using, by running the cell which does imports below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the instructions in this notebook carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the required code/markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will use the IAML Learn page for any announcements, updates, and FAQs on this assignment. Please ***visit the page frequently*** to find the latest information/changes.\n",
    "- Data files that you will be using are included in the [git repository](https://github.com/uoe-iaml/DL-S2-2022-CW2) for this coursework.\n",
    "- There is a helper file 'iaml22cw2_helpers.py' in the git repository, which you should upload to your environment.\n",
    "- Some of the topics in this coursework are covered in weeks 7 and 8 of the course. Focus first on questions on topics that you have covered already, and come back to the other questions as the lectures progress.\n",
    "- Keep your answers brief and concise.\n",
    "- Make sure to show all your code/working.\n",
    "- All the figures you present should have axis labels, titles, and grid lines unless specified explicitly. If you think grid lines spoiling readability, you can adjust the line width and/or line style. Figures should not be too small to read.\n",
    "- Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow PEP8 to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. Do use inline comments when doing something non-standard.\n",
    "- When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer. \n",
    "- When you use libraries specified in this coursework, you should use the default parameters unless specified explicitly.\n",
    "- The criteria on which you will be judged include the quality of the textual answers and/or any plots asked for. For higher marks, when asked you need to give good and concise discussions based on experiments and theories using your own words.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will submit (1) a PDF of your Notebook via Gradescope, and (2) the Notebook itself via Learn.  Your grade will be based on the PDF, we will only use the Notebook if we need to see details.  **You must use the following procedure to create the materials to submit**.\n",

    "1. Make sure your Notebook and the datasets are in Noteable and will run.  If you developed your answers in Noteable, this is already done.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select **Kernel->Restart & Run All** to create a clean copy of your submission, this will run the cells in order from top to bottom.  This may take a while (a few hours) to complete, ensure that all the output and plots have complete before you proceed.\n",
